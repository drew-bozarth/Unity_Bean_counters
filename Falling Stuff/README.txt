Known Errors:
At end of game timer, gameplay stops score appears on screen for 5 seconds,
then you are taken to the main menu instead of the score appearing on the main
menu. Within State class, using playerManager caused compile errors so it was removed.
Building on Mac for PC caused the build to not appear formatted correctly. Was unable
To build successfully from Mac, so included is the entire project zip.
